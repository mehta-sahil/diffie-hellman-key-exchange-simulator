# Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange Simulator

An interactive web-based educational tool that simulates the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm with step-by-step animations.  
The project also includes sections explaining its importance in cryptography and a breakdown of how the algorithm works.  
Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for educational purposes.  

## Project Structure

- index.html : Main simulator page (interactive animation with Alice, Bob, Eve)  
- importance.html : Page explaining the importance & real-world applications  
- howItWorks.html : Page explaining the step-by-step working and math behind DH  
- style.css : Common stylesheet (layout, colors, animations, UI styling)  
- script.js : Logic for the simulator (handling key generation, animations, interactions)  

## Features

- Interactive Simulator: Step-by-step visual simulation of the Diffie–Hellman key exchange between Alice and Bob.  
- Attacker View: Simulated “Eve” panel showing what an eavesdropper can observe.  
- Educational Pages:  
  - Importance: Historical significance, security benefits, and real-world applications (TLS, VPN, Messaging).  
  - How it Works: Mathematical foundation, detailed steps, formulas, and security considerations.  
- Animations & UI: Simple animations for message passing and value exchanges.  
- Beginner Friendly: Designed as a teaching tool for students to understand cryptography basics.  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/mehta-sahil/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-simulator.git  
   cd diffie-hellman-key-exchange-simulator  

2. Open index.html in any modern web browser.

   - How it Works  

No external dependencies required. Runs fully in the browser.  

## Live Demo


## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the basics of public-key cryptography.  
- Visualize the Diffie–Hellman key exchange and its role in secure communications.  
- Explore real-world applications in TLS, VPNs, SSH, and messaging apps.  
- Hands-on practice with HTML, CSS animations, and JavaScript logic.  

## Future Improvements

- Add Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) variant.  
- Add Man-in-the-Middle attack simulation.  
- Provide a live hosted demo (GitHub Pages / Netlify).  
- Improve animations and add visual math explanations.  

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
